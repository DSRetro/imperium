# Imperium

![github-large](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DSRetro/imperium/master/img/i.png)

Imperium is a programming language built entirely in Python 3 and C. The aim isn't to produce a commercial language, but to produce a powerful, feature-rich interpreted language that can be used to produce both command line applications and simple GUIs. It is free for anyone to use and modify and I will aim to provide regular updates after the project is released.

# Getting Started

During development, no package will be available, however the source can be cloned using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/DSRetro/imperium/
```

Eventually, when the project is released, a package will available on PyPI, and I will release the .whl and .tar.gz files here.

# TODO
